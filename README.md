# Countdown Clock

A web page that counts the time down to the end of 2016.

## Creation

  - __Time Spent__: Approximately 90 minutes.
  - __Tools Chosen__: Because this was a very simple application with no need for maintaining application state, I decided to keep it 
  lightweight and did not use any libraries or frameworks.  I only used vanilla javascript, css and html. 
  - __Bugs / improvements I'd like to make__: I'd like to make the js code dryer and turn the countdown clock into a reusable library.  I'd also like to make the UI responsive, and fix it so it renders properly on browsers that don't support flexbox.
